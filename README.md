I am a Data Analyst working for the charity, Education for All. I have been asked by the Head of Fundraising to present the data on donor insights and donation rates.
Within the Fundraising team, my objectives are to:
Increase the number of donors in your database
Increase the donation frequency of your donors.
Increase the value of donations in your database.
I will be working with the datasets EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data
In two weeks my team will be having a fundraising strategy meeting for the following year, and I will need to present insights from the donation data to inform your fundraising strategy and increase donations. And offer possible solutions to meet up with the above objectives.

In my analysis i used the SQL lite online and applied the following SQl Query commands. 
‘’JOIN, LEFT JOIN, ORDER BY, WHERE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, SUM (), COUNT (), AVG (), GROUP BY, HAVING, MIN(), MAX() ‘’
I also narrowed down a few questions With the Root Cause analysis for a better  understanding and I came up with Quality insights of provided data sets, prepared visualizations, and report for my team.
We have to realize that we are running a non profitable organization, this entails that we can only generate funds by increase in the number of donors, and donation frequency . There was need to find out the variation of donations, the frequency of the donations and why.  I applied Root Cause Analysis to ask some key questions about our Database: 
Why is the donation rate in our charity organization low 
Because we haven't effectively communicated the impact and need for this donations to a wider range of potential donors

Why haven't we effectively communicated the impact and need for this donations to a wider range of potential donors
Because our marketing strategies hasn’t been effective enough to reach targeted potential donors

3. Why is our marketing strategies not been effective enough to reach targeted  potential donors
Because we lack enough information's which would have been helpful in making strategic marketing decisions

Why do we lack enough information which would have been helpful in making strategic marketing decisions
 Because our Dataset lack enough information that would have been useful for a better analysis and the  making of strategic marketing decisions

5. Why does our Dataset  lack  enough information that would have been useful for analysis to make strategic marketing decisions
Because we didn’t collect enough and useful information's from our donors , like how our donors learnt about our charity organization(in other to use this channel and explore channels to reach out to a wider range of donors), The age of our donors(in other to enable us know the age group of our donors and be strategic in our marketing strategy)
The business problem is the difficulty of the charity organization to grow funding. Therefore, it’s required to seek donors who can donate on regular base and will increase the value of their donations. I had to present my report in two weeks. 
To understand the problem, I needed to analyze existing data bases of Donors and Donations. Also, I should present crucial numbers and visualizations of data sets

 I decided to ask some questions to dig the problem deeper.
1. How many donors do we have in our existing dataset? 
2. What is the total amount of donations? 
3. How many male and female donors do we have and what is sum of their donations?
4. What is the frequency of donations and how do they vary?
5. What job field, State has the most amount of donation and how do they vary?
